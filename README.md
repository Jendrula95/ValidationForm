Simply form validator



The project shows Real-time validations: The JavaScript script checks the input data as it is entered by the user.
Error messages: If the entered data is incorrect, the user is informed about this by displaying appropriate messages.
Error styling: Error fields are highlighted with a blue outline, making it easier for the user to identify the problem.
Prevent form submission: The form will not be submitted if it contains errors, which prevents incorrect data from being submitted to the server.
